  /// Provides a utility method to assert snapshot tests for SwiftUI views, ensuring consistent visual output.
  /// This method integrates with the ``SnapshotTesting`` library.
  ///
  /// This method ensures snapshots are stored in different locations for CI and local testing environments.
  /// On failure, an ``XCTFail`` is triggered with a descriptive error message.
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - view: The SwiftUI view to be snapshotted and tested.
  ///   - size: The frame size for the view. Defaults to iPhone 14 size (393x852).
  ///   - precision: The precision threshold for image comparison (default is 0.95).
  ///   - ciPath: The path for storing snapshots when running on a CI environment.
  ///   - record: A flag indicating whether to record a new reference snapshot (default is `false`).
  ///   - file: The source file where the assertion is called (default is the current file).
  ///   - testName: The name of the test method (default is the current function name).
  ///   - line: The line number where the assertion is called (default is the current line).
